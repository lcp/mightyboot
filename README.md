# mightyboot

Mightyboot is a collection of services to quickly set up a PXE and HTTP(S)
Boot server for an isolated network environment. It comprises of 4 services:

* **dhcp** - DHCP service for IPv4
* **dhcp6** - DHCP service for IPv6
* **dnsmasq** - DNS and tftp services
* **lighttpd** - HTTP service

All service are run in the **host** network mode.

## Configuration

The related settings are controlled by the **env** file. There are several
environment variables, and the start-up scripts in the services will adjust the
config files accordingly. Here are the variables:

* **IFACE** - which network interface the services should listen to
* **IP4_PREFIX** - the prefix of IPv4 address of the target interface
* **IP6_PREFIX** - the prefix of IPv6 address of the target interface
* **PXE_URI** - the path to the bootloader in the tftp server
* **SERVER_NAME** - the domain name of the server
* **HTTPBOOT_URI** - the IPv4 HTTP URI to the UEFI bootloader
* **HTTPBOOT6_URI** - the IPv6 HTTP URI to the UEFI bootloader
* **SERVER_KEY** - the encrypt key for HTTPS

### Network Interface

Mightyboot assumes the IP addresses of the interface are **IP4_PREFIX**.1/24
and **IP6_PREFIX**1/64.

For example, to use mightyboot on *eth0* with **IP4_PREFIX**=192.168.110 and
**IP6_PREFIX**=2001:db8:f00f:cafe::, then the IP addresses of *eth0* **should**
be 192.168.110.1/24 and 2001:db8:f00f:cafe::1/64.

### DHCP

The ranges of DHCP IP addresses are **IP4_PREFIX**.100 to **IP4_PREFIX**.200
and **IP6_PREFIX**42:10 to **IP6_PREFIX**42:99. So, the ranges of DHCP IP
addresses in the previous example will be 192.168.110.100 to 192.168.110.200
and 2001:db8:f00f:cafe::42:10 to 2001:db8:f00f:cafe::42:99.

### PXE Path

Mightyboot mounts *data/tftproot* as the tftproot for dnsmasq. The user has to
install the pxe bootlader in *data/tftproot* and set **PXE_URI** properly.

For openSUSE/SLE, we just copy *EFI* and *boot* from openSUSE/SLE DVD image to
*data/tftproot/opensuse*, and set **PXE_URI** as */opensuse/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi*.

NOTE: Remember to adjust the paths in *grub.cfg*

### DNS

The domain name of the server can be customized with **SERVER_NAME**. The
dnsmasq service will map the default IPv4/IPv6 address to the specified
domain name.

### HTTP

Mightyboot mounts *data/www/htdocs* to */srv/www/htdocs* for lighttpd service,
so the HTTPBoot bootloader has to be installed in *data/www/htdocs*.

There are 2 HTTPBoot variables: **HTTPBOOT_URI** for IPv4 and
**HTTPBOOT6_URI** for IPv6. Both of them point to the specified bootloader.

Since HTTP server also can be the installation server of openSUSE/SLE, we can
copy everything in the installation DVD to *data/www/htdocs/suse* and set the URI
to "http://SERVER_NAME/suse/EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi".

NOTE: Remember to adjust the paths in *grub.cfg*

### HTTPS

To enable HTTPS support in mightyboot, you need a server key.
Please refer [SSL Support for HTTP Server](https://en.opensuse.org/UEFI_HTTPBoot_with_OVMF#SSL_Support_for_HTTP_Server.28Optional.29)
to create a test key if necessary. The server key **must** contain both
the public certificate and the private key.

After creating the server key, copy the server key file to *data/lighttpd*.
Then, assign the file name of the server key to **SERVER_KEY**. For example:

    SERVER_KEY=server.pem

### Grub2

There is a grub.cfg example in *data* in case you need a reference of grub.cfg.

## Launch Services

### Docker

For the docker users, Just make sure that your system already install docker
and docker-compose and run:

    $ docker-compose up

This first startup time will be longer since docker-compose has to download
and build images for the services. Once the images are cached, it will be much
faster.

### Podman

For the podman users, `mightyboot-podman.sh` is the script to manage the
container services. Since podman requires the root privilege to control the
host network interface, it is necessary to run the script with `sudo`. There
are 5 subcommands in the script: `start`, `rebuild`, `stop`, `remove`, and
`status`. To launch the services, just run:

    $ sudo ./mightyboot-podman.sh start

Then the script will build the images (for the first startup) and start
the services.

All messages from the services are redirected to journald. For example,
to check the messages from the **DHCP** container:

    $ sudo journalctl --identifier mightyboot-dhcp
